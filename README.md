# Test-Java-Network
A simple Java Chat application with GUI over network

## How to run
1. Run __java my.net.SimpleChatServer__ for server at the appropriate folder (you may need to allow the software's access to your network when the prompt is shown)
   The server can be used for broadcasting message to its connected clients by typing into the console directly.
2. Run __java my.net.SimpleChatClient__ for client. This will open a Java Swing GUI app for you to play with.

You can run as many clients as you want for any particular server. 
It's like a big chat room for people to communicate but you might need to re-compile with the new IP and port settings inside the source files.
